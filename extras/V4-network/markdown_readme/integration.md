**Goal:** Add network infrastructure without breaking existing V4 functionality

#### 1.1 File Structure Additions
```
V4-network/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase-chat.js         (copy from StoryTeller - network core)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ character-sync-manager.js (new - bidirectional character sync)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network-integration.js   (new - V4 integration glue code)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ map-client.js           (adapted from player-test.html)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network-ui.css          (new - chat/map UI styles)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ supabase.key.md             (copy from StoryTeller)
```

#### 1.2 HTML Structure Updates
**Target:** `index.html` sidebar navigation section (around line 160)

**Add new tabs after magic tab:**
```html
<button class="sidebar-tab" data-tab="chat">
    <span class="tab-icon"><i class="ra ra-conversation"></i></span>
    <span class="tab-label">Game Chat</span>
</button>
<button class="sidebar-tab" data-tab="map">
    <span class="tab-icon"><i class="ra ra-map"></i></span>
    <span class="tab-label">Shared Map</span>
</button>
```

**Add content containers in main content area:**
```html
<!-- Chat Tab Content -->
<div class="tab-content" id="chat-content">
    <div class="network-section">
        <div class="session-controls">
            <input type="text" id="session-code-input" placeholder="Enter session code">
            <button onclick="joinGameSession()">Join Game</button>
        </div>
        <div id="chat-messages-container"></div>
        <div class="chat-input-container">
            <input type="text" id="message-input" placeholder="Type message...">
            <button onclick="sendChatMessage()">Send</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<!-- Map Tab Content -->
<div class="tab-content" id="map-content">
    <div id="map-viewer-container">
        <canvas id="player-map-canvas"></canvas>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Phase 2: Character Synchronization System üîÑ
**Goal:** Seamless bidirectional character data sync between player and DM

#### 2.1 Character Sync Manager (`character-sync-manager.js`)
**Core Functions:**
- `initCharacterSync()` - Hook into existing character save functions
- `syncCharacterToNetwork()` - Send character data via Supabase game commands
- `receiveCharacterUpdates()` - Handle DM modifications to character
- `handleCharacterConflicts()` - Resolve simultaneous edits

**Integration Points:**
- Hook into `saveCurrentCharacterToStorage()` in `character-manager.js`
- Add network sync call after successful local storage
- Preserve all existing functionality

**Data Flow:**
```
Player Edit ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí Network Sync ‚Üí StoryTeller IndexedDB
   ‚Üì                                              ‚Üì
Character Update ‚Üê Network Sync ‚Üê DM Modification
```

#### 2.2 Network Data Structure
**Character Sync Message Format:**
```javascript
{
    type: 'character_update',
    playerId: 'player_name',
    characterId: 'character_uuid',
    character: {
        // Complete character object from main.js
        name: '', level: 1, stats: {}, inventory: [], etc.
    },
    timestamp: '2025-08-30T...',
    source: 'player' | 'dm'
}
```

### Phase 3: Chat Integration üí¨

- Barter/trade system between players

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach
1. **Non-Breaking Integration:** All existing V4 functionality preserved
2. **Progressive Enhancement:** Network features are additive
3. **Graceful Degradation:** App works offline if network unavailable
4. **Modular Design:** Each network feature can be enabled/disabled

### Development Workflow
1. **Copy Proven Components:** Start with working StoryTeller network code
2. **Minimal Viable Product:** Chat + character sync first
3. **Iterative Enhancement:** Add map, then advanced features
4. **Extensive Testing:** Verify no existing functionality broken

### Session Workflow (User Experience)
1. **DM:** Creates session in StoryTeller, shares join code
2. **Player:** Opens V4-network app, clicks "Chat" tab
3. **Player:** Enters join code, automatically connects
4. **Background:** Character sync begins silently
5. **DM:** Sees player join, views their character sheet
6. **Both:** Real-time chat, map sharing, combat coordination
