# 🎯 Hexagonal Dungeon Gauntlet System - Implementation Phases

## 🏗️ **Phase Architecture Overview**

### **Core Party System Design**
```javascript
// Future-proof party structure
const combatParty = {
  players: [
    { name: "brad", type: "player", level: 5, hp: 45, maxHp: 45 },
    { name: "claude", type: "player", level: 4, hp: 32, maxHp: 38 },
    { name: "Thorin", type: "npc", level: 3, hp: 28, maxHp: 30, attitude: "aggressive" }
  ],
  averagePartyLevel: 4,
  gold: 1200,
  formation: "standard" // for positioning on hex grid
};
```

### **NPC Attitude System**
- **`aggressive`**: Prioritizes damage attacks
- **`defensive`**: Uses shields/healing when available  
- **`magicOnly`**: Prefers spells over physical attacks
- **`support`**: Focuses on buffs/healing party members
- **`balanced`**: Mix of all tactics

## 📋 **PHASE 1: Foundation & Single Combat**
*Target: Basic working system with 1 player vs 1 enemy*

### **Deliverables:**
- [ ] Combat modal overlay system
- [ ] Single rotating sprite cylinder enemy
- [ ] Single hex base platform with glow effects
- [ ] Basic attack menu (Weapon/Magic/Skill)
- [ ] Turn-based state machine
- [ ] Damage calculation integration

### **File Structure:**
```
v5/js/combat/
├── CombatManager.js     // Main controller & modal management
├── PartyManager.js      // Party data structure (future-ready)
├── CombatRenderer.js    // 3D hex bases & sprite cylinders
└── TurnManager.js       // Initiative & turn logic
```

### **Party Integration:**
- PartyManager supports multiple members from day 1
- Combat starts with `party.players[0]` (current player)
- UI shows "1 of 1" party member indicator

---

## 📋 **PHASE 2: Multi-Enemy & Enhanced UI**
*Target: 1 player vs 2-3 enemies with full interface*

### **Deliverables:**
- [ ] Multiple enemy positioning with depth scaling
- [ ] Initiative tracker sidebar
- [ ] Enemy AI action selection from JSON data
- [ ] Attack animations and damage numbers
- [ ] Health bar visualization for all participants

### **New Features:**
- Corridor angle variation (left/right perspectives)
- Enemy threat level color coding on hex bases
- Mobile-optimized touch targets
- Chat FAB remains accessible during combat

---

## 📋 **PHASE 3: Full Party Combat**
*Target: 2-4 players vs multiple enemies*

### **Deliverables:**
- [ ] Party formation positioning system
- [ ] Player data fetching from Storyteller (cached)
- [ ] Multiple player turn management
- [ ] Party-wide status effects
- [ ] Gold/loot distribution system

### **Party Features:**
```javascript
// Example multi-player setup
const activeParty = {
  players: [
    { name: "brad", position: "front-left" },
    { name: "claude", position: "back-center" },
    { name: "david", position: "front-right" }
  ],
  formation: "triangle", // triangle, line, diamond
  combatBonus: "pack_tactics" // party size bonuses
};
```

---

## 📋 **PHASE 4: NPC Integration & Advanced AI**
*Target: Mixed parties with NPCs and intelligent behaviors*

### **Deliverables:**
- [ ] NPC attitude-based AI system
- [ ] Smart target selection for NPCs
- [ ] NPC dialogue during combat
- [ ] Advanced enemy AI patterns
- [ ] Environmental hazards integration

### **NPC Combat Example:**
```javascript
// NPC turn logic
if (npc.attitude === "aggressive") {
  target = getWeakestEnemy();
  action = getHighestDamageAttack();
} else if (npc.attitude === "defensive") {
  target = getMostInjuredAlly();
  action = getBestHealingSpell();
}
```

---

## 📋 **PHASE 5: Integration & Polish**
*Target: Seamless integration with main game systems*

### **Deliverables:**
- [ ] GRIND command integration
- [ ] Floor-based enemy scaling
- [ ] Experience/leveling integration
- [ ] Loot system with inventory updates
- [ ] Achievement system hooks

### **Integration Points:**
- Map encounter triggers
- Character sheet updates
- Storyteller command compatibility
- Save/load state management

---

## 🎨 **Visual Evolution by Phase**

### **Phase 1:** Basic cylinder + hex + menu
### **Phase 2:** Multiple enemies + initiative tracker
### **Phase 3:** Party formation + enhanced UI
### **Phase 4:** NPC integration + smart AI
### **Phase 5:** Full environmental themes + effects

---

## 🔧 **Technical Considerations**

### **Mobile-First Design:**
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Swipe gestures for menu navigation
- Responsive hex scaling
- Performance optimization for older devices

### **Memory Management:**
- Player data caching strategy
- Texture preloading for enemy sprites
- 3D scene cleanup between combats
- Mobile memory constraints

### **Future Expansion Hooks:**
- Plugin system for new enemy types
- Custom formation definitions
- Scriptable NPC behaviors
- Dynamic environmental effects

## 🚀 **When You're Ready...**

We'll start with **Phase 1** - get the basic foundation working with your current single-player setup, but architected to seamlessly expand to full parties later.

The beauty of this approach:
- ✅ **Immediate progress** with Phase 1
- ✅ **Future-proof architecture** from day 1  
- ✅ **Natural expansion** path to full party system
- ✅ **No rework needed** when adding party members

Take your time with food! This system is going to be amazing. 🎮
