# Tileset List Configuration
# Add tileset names here (one per line)
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Each tileset name should correspond to both a .png and .json file in the assets folder
#
# Example: If you add "mystical" here, you need:
#   - assets/mystical.png (sprite sheet image)
#   - assets/mystical.json (tileset configuration)
#
# Current tilesets:

default
forest
GreenTest
Gothic
Transparent

# To add new tilesets:
# 1. Copy your PNG sprite sheet to this assets folder
# 2. Create a JSON config file (copy default.json as template)
# 3. Add the tileset name (without .png/.json) to this list
# 4. Restart the map editor to see the new tileset
