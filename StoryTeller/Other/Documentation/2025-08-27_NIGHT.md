# Development Session - August 27, 2025 Night

## Session Overview
**Focus:** Fix Edit Map functionality to load selected maps into the map editor modal with proper sprite display

**Duration:** Extended debugging session focused on map editor integration

**Primary Goal:** Make Edit Map buttons load the selected map data into the editor and display it visually

## What We Worked On

### 1. Edit Map Button Investigation
- **Issue:** Edit Map buttons existed but weren't loading selected map data into editor
- **Discovery:** Button ID mismatch - editor looked for `open-map-modal` but HTML had `edit-map-btn`
- **Finding:** Maps were loading successfully (filename appeared) but sprites weren't displaying

### 2. Map Loading Flow Analysis
- **Maps Manager:** Uses IndexedDB storage with `editMap()` function
- **Data Flow:** IndexedDB → `savedMaps` Map → `pendingMapToLoad` → `loadMapFromData()`
- **Storage Confirmed:** System correctly uses IndexedDB, not localStorage

### 3. Sprite Display Investigation
- **Root Cause:** Default tileset maps weren't calling sprite CSS generation
- **Problem:** `loadMapFromData()` only called `switchTileset()` for custom tilesets
- **Viewer Comparison:** Map viewer works correctly, editor doesn't

### 4. CSS Generation Fixes
- **Attempted Fix:** Made `loadMapFromData()` async and always call tileset switching
- **CSS Targeting:** Updated maps manager CSS to target both `.viewer-tile .sprite` and `.map-tile .sprite`
- **Approach:** Copied working viewer sprite CSS generation to editor

## What Works ✅

### Maps Panel & Viewer
- **Maps List:** Displays correctly in left sidebar
- **Map Selection:** Clicking maps shows details and loads viewer
- **Sprite Display:** Map viewer shows sprites correctly with proper positioning
- **CSS System:** Viewer sprite CSS generation works perfectly
- **Background Colors:** Proper background colors behind sprites

### Map Editor Modal
- **Modal Opening:** Edit buttons successfully open map editor modal
- **Data Loading:** Map data loads correctly (filename shows in save field)
- **Grid Creation:** 15x15 grid created with proper tile structure
- **Modal Persistence:** Modal stays open during loading process

### Storage System
- **IndexedDB Integration:** All map storage uses IndexedDB correctly
- **Data Retrieval:** Maps load from storage without issues
- **Format Handling:** Multiple map formats supported (nested grid, flat array)

## What Doesn't Work ❌

### Map Editor Sprite Display
- **Visual Display:** Maps show as white/blank grid in editor
- **Sprite Rendering:** Sprites don't appear despite correct data loading
- **CSS Application:** Sprite CSS not applying to editor tiles
- **Background Colors:** No background colors showing

### Edit Map Integration
- **Primary Issue:** Selected maps don't display visually in editor
- **Data vs Display:** Data loads correctly but rendering fails
- **Viewer vs Editor:** Same data works in viewer but not editor

## Technical Details

### Code Changes Made
1. **map-editor.js:**
   - Made `loadMapFromData()` async
   - Updated tileset switching to always call CSS generation
   - Simplified `renderTile()` function to match viewer approach
   - Removed `spritesEnabled` check that was blocking sprites

2. **maps-manager.js:**
   - Made `loadMapFormat()` async
   - Updated CSS generation to target `.map-tile .sprite`
   - Added proper await calls for async operations

### CSS System
- **Viewer CSS:** Works with `.viewer-tile .sprite` selectors
- **Editor CSS:** Updated to include `.map-tile .sprite` selectors
- **Sprite Positioning:** Uses percentage-based positioning for 4x4 sprite grid
- **Background Size:** 400% 400% for proper sprite scaling

## Debugging Approach

### What We Learned
- **Data Flow:** Map data loading works correctly end-to-end
- **Viewer Success:** Sprite rendering works perfectly in viewer
- **CSS Scope:** Different CSS selectors needed for viewer vs editor
- **Timing Issues:** Async operations need proper await handling

### Key Findings
- **Storage:** IndexedDB integration is solid
- **Data Integrity:** Map data preserves sprite information correctly
- **Viewer Model:** Working sprite system exists and is referenceable
- **Editor Gap:** Rendering pipeline different between viewer and editor

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Immediate Priority
1. **Debug White Grid:** Investigate why editor shows white grid instead of sprites
2. **CSS Inspection:** Check if CSS rules are actually being applied to editor tiles
3. **Element Structure:** Compare DOM structure between working viewer and non-working editor

### Investigation Points
1. **CSS Selector Specificity:** Ensure editor CSS has proper specificity
2. **Timing Issues:** Check if CSS loads before tile rendering
3. **Image Loading:** Verify sprite images load correctly for editor
4. **Background Application:** Debug why background colors don't show

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Copy Exact Viewer Code:** Use identical rendering code from viewer
2. **Direct CSS Injection:** Apply CSS directly to editor elements
3. **Debug Individual Tiles:** Test single tile rendering in isolation

## Session Notes

- **User Feedback:** Too much debugging output made troubleshooting difficult
- **Approach Change:** Focused on copying working viewer code instead of fixing editor code
- **Key Insight:** Viewer proves the sprite system works - need to replicate approach
- **End State:** Map loading works but visual display remains the primary blocker

## File Status

### Modified Files
- `StoryTeller/js/map-editor.js` - Updated async functions and sprite rendering
- `StoryTeller/js/maps-manager.js` - Updated CSS generation and async calls

### Working Components
- Maps Manager with IndexedDB storage
- Map viewer with full sprite display
- Modal system and data loading
- Map format conversion and handling

### Broken Components
- Map editor sprite display (white grid issue)
- Edit map visual rendering
- Sprite CSS application in editor context

---

**Status:** Edit map functionality loads data correctly but visual display remains broken. Viewer provides working model to follow.
